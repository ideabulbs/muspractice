muspractice
===========

muspractice is a practice assistant tool based on spaced repetition
method. Scheduled repetitions take advantage of the spacing effect of
your memory, making it easier to rehearse musical material at optimal
time intervals.

muspractice allows you maintain a database of musical exercises,
create prioritized lists for practice sessions. Practice sessions are
logged. This historical data gives you the possibility to keep track
of your practicing and adjust your future priorities.

Exercises can be images, sound clips or both. It is possible to adjust
the pitch of the sound clips, and change tempo. Practising sessions
can be recorded automatically.
